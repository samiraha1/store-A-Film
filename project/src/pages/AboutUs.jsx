            <p class="p">I watch so many movies in life but the minute I'm asked what's your favorite movie of a certain
                genre or just
                in general, I can never remember. This is the reason I've decided to create a website where you can keep
                track
                of the movies and shows you watch while also connecting with others who have the same interest.
